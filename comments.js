// In JavaScript, you can add comments using two types of syntax: single-line comments and multi-line comments. 
// Comments are ignored by the JavaScript engine and are used by developers to explain code, add documentation,
// and temporarily disable code during testing or debugging. 

// Types of Comments
// Single-line comments: These start with two forward slashes (//). 
// // All text after // to the end of the line is treated as a comment.

// This is a single-line comment
let name = "JavaScript"; // An inline comment

// Multi-line comments: These start with /* and end with */. Any text between the opening 
// and closing tags can span multiple lines.
